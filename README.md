# ReflectJS

Reflected JS Injection. Learn it quick.


## Setup

Clone this repo:
```
git clone https://github.com/Gr4y-r0se/reflectjs.git
```

Navigate into the directory:
```
cd reflectjs
```

Set up and seed the database:
```
php init_db.php
php seed_db.php
```

Navigate into webroot:
```
cd webroot
```

and then, spin up a low budget PHP server:
```
php -S 0.0.0.0:80
```

Finally, try and find the reflected JavaScript injection. There are two.
